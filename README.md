# nodejs-odata-server
This project is supposed to become kind of a lightweight, customizable odata server powered by Node.js.

# dependencies
This project depends on a copy of [abnfjs](https://github.com/datokrat/abnfjs) located at "../abnfjs", my GitHub project parsing and interpreting ABNF specifications. Apart of this, the only dependencies are the popular "connect" package and the lightweight database "diskdb" for database connection testing purposes (see package.json).
